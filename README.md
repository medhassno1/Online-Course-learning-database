Online Course learning database

The basic model of the system is an application used to load course information and history into a database system.  This will allow the client to switch to a single application with different type of users that can access the system and make changes to it. There will be a final administrator who has a full control over the application. The edit permission is only allowed to certain users to avoid redundancy. We also will add a notification area which explains what all changes has been made to all the data. Other basic requirements include:

•	Print reports
•	Multiple users at once
•	Accessible online
•	Course loader make the final version
•	After the withdraw due date, course loader make a report to budget officer to plan the budget
